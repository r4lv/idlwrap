    "\n",
    "With `numpy` and `scipy`, there are powerful and open-source tools available for scientific computing in python. Currently, still lots of scientific projects — especially in astrophysics — rely on the proprietary and expensive IDL programming language instead of moving foward to open and reproducible science. This guide aims to help in porting an IDL codebase to python, while taking full advantage of its powers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For help with porting specific IDL functions and routines you are invited to look at the source code of `idlwrap`, which has porting instructions in its docstrings.\n",

    "In IDL, `ROUND` uses *round-half-away-from-zero*, also known as *commercial rounding*. That's what you usually learn in school. It treats positive and negative values symmetrically: If positive and negative numbers are equally probable, this rounding is free of any bias.\n",

    "python / numpy use *half-to-even* / *financial rounding* / *mathematical rounding*, which is the default rounding mode in the IEEE-754 standard.
